# Visual Classifier Baselines <br>
This model include 8 basline methods.<br>
## **1. Sparse Representation based Classifier (SRC)**, 
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2008<br>
https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/103886/08-2203.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y<br>
This method has been optimized by two approaches,<br>
i) Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), the main functiona is **main_SRC_ADMM**
ii) Blockwise Coordinate Descent (BCD), the main functiona is **main_SRC**
## **2. Collaborative Representation based Classifier (CRC)**, 
IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011<br>
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.231.8008&rep=rep1&type=pdf<br>
The main functiona is **main_CRC**
